This project involved creating an advanced chatbot for OnxHomes, integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT API. The bot was designed to handle real estate inquiries, providing users with a seamless and interactive experience. Key features included history tracking, a custom popup chat interface, streaming API responses, and engaging animations. I also implemented speech-to-text and text-to-speech functionalities for enhanced accessibility. The project, developed using HTML, CSS, and JS, showcases a significant leap in AI-driven customer service within the real estate sector.
