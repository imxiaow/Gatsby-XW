I had the opportunity to photograph the Red Bull 3x3 World Cup Basketball Tournament in Toronto. This project focused on capturing the high-energy and dynamic nature of the tournament, showcasing athletes' skills and the vibrant atmosphere. My work involved taking action shots that conveyed the excitement and competitiveness of the games. The photographs were used to highlight the event's success and to promote future tournaments, garnering positive attention and enhancing the event's visual storytelling.
