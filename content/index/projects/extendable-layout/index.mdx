Deep learning-based	analysis on histopathology images of lung cancer. Performed inference and transfer learning on TCGA pre-trained GoogLet-Inception V3 CNN using Providence dataset. Improved performance from AUC less than 0.5 to 0.74 by transfer learning. Adapted pre-trained InceptionResNetV2 models from Keras application and developed customized python scripts for further transfer learning.
