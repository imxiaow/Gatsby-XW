Implemented deep learning techniques for analyzing histopathology images of lung cancer, focusing on cancer type classification and gene mutation status prediction. Preprocessed 500+ digital pathology slides using OpenCV; enhanced model accuracy using GoogLeNet-Inception V3 CNN with transfer learning, achieving an AUC increase from <0.5 to 0.74. Utilized and adapted InceptionResNetV2 pre-trained models from Keras; wrote Python scripts to facilitate transfer learning processes.
