I captured the essence of a vibrant live house rap music event, focusing on the raw energy and rhythm of the night. The project entailed photographing performers in action and the audience's engagement, highlighting the connection between the artists and their fans. My work emphasized the intensity and passion of the rap performances, as well as the unique atmosphere of the event. These images were instrumental in showcasing the event's dynamic nature and promoting the lively local music scene.
