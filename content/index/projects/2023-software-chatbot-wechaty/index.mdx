This project showcases a sophisticated Chatbot built using Wechaty, designed to auto-reply messages on WeChat. A key feature is its ability to display a QR code for user authentication, allowing the bot to respond on behalf of the user. It utilizes pattern matching for preset replies and integrates ChatGPT for dynamic messaging. The highlight of this project is its capability to operate seamlessly across social media platforms like WeChat, WhatsApp, and Instagram, a unique feat given the limited sources capable of operating on behalf of WeChat users.
