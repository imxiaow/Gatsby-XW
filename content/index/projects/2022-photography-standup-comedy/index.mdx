I had the opportunity to photograph a standup comedy event, focusing on capturing the essence of live comedic performance. This project involved taking candid shots of the comedians in action and the audience's reactions, highlighting the humorous and spontaneous moments. My work aimed to encapsulate the lively and engaging atmosphere of the event, portraying the connection between the performers and their audience. The photographs served to promote the event and provide a visual narrative of the night's entertainment.
