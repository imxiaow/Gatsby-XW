Hi, I’m Xiao, and I’m currently diving into the world of aviation through a two-year Aircraft Maintenance Engineering program. After several years working in software engineering, I decided to take a step back from tech to expand my skills, challenge myself in new ways, and pursue hands-on engineering experience. This shift is about growth, exploration, and seeing how technology can shape industries like aviation and aerospace.  

In my previous roles as a Research Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.quartic.ai/" target="_blank" rel="" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Quartic.ai Inc.</Underlining></a> and Lead Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.infinityvc.ca/" target="_blank" rel="" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Infinity Vision Consulting</Underlining></a>, I led full-stack and front-end development projects, contributing to AI-driven solutions and web applications that drove business growth.  

I hold a Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine from Oregon Health & Science University and an Honors Bachelor of Science from the University of Toronto. My academic background shaped how I approach complex systems and sharpened my ability to think analytically and creatively.  

Outside of aircraft maintenance and software, I enjoy exploring new interests and environments. I’m certified in CPR/AED First Aid, and hold firearms licenses. I’ve also delved into photography and videography, with my work featured by brands like Wilson Basketball. These experiences—whether technical, creative, or hands-on—reflect my belief in **continuous learning, adaptability, and stepping outside my comfort zone.**  

#### **Where I’m Headed**
I’m deeply interested in how **technology intersects with aviation, aerospace, and defense.** As I continue developing my skills in aircraft maintenance, I’m exploring how software, AI, and IoT can transform aviation systems—particularly in predictive maintenance, avionics, and aerospace innovation. I’m excited by opportunities that allow me to contribute to **tech-driven aviation projects or startups** that are reshaping the industry.  

#### **Let’s Connect**  
If you’re working at the intersection of **tech and aviation** or involved in **innovative aerospace projects,** I’d love to connect and exchange ideas. My goal is to bridge these worlds, contributing to exciting advancements in aviation technology.
