Currently, I am starting my full-time position as a Research Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.quartic.ai/" target="_blank" rel="" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Quartic.ai Inc.</Underlining></a> where I work closely with the AI team.

I graduated from Oregon Health & Science University with a Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine in **June 2020**. I extended the internship remotely at <a href="https://omicsautomation.com/" target="_blank" rel="" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Omics Data Automation Inc </Underlining></a> until **October 2020**. 

Soon later, I started to learn MERN stack web development and helped several local businesses in Toronto to develop their websites during the COVID-19 lockdown until **February 2021**.
