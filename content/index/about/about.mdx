import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

Currently, I am starting my full-time position as a Research Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.quartic.ai/" target="_blank" rel="" aria-label="External Link"><Underlining>Quartic.ai Inc.</Underlining></a> where I work closely with the AI team.

I obtained my Master's degree in Bioinformatics and Computational Biomedicine from Oregon Health & Science University. I obtained my Bachelor's degree also in Bioinformatics from the University of Toronto. During my study, I have work with large-scale omics, image, signal dataset analysis with applied machine learning, deep learning models. I also conducted a few clinical shadowing in inpatient and outpatient setting to assess the technical challenges and potential computational solutions to improve the clinical workflow.

During the COVID-19 lockdown, I helped several local businesses in Toronto to develop their websites. I also spend some time thinking about what I really excited about as a few graduates. I want to get exposure to the different aspects of the tech industry. While I am still really interested in research and new technologies, I realized the importance of developing user friendly products and the importance of delivering them in the form of a website or app. Similar to precision medicine or patient-centered healthcare, any products or designs also have to be user-centered. 

Luckily, I met and joined Quartic.ai Inc. where I can involve in both research and dev.
